# choice-driven-economy
A blueprint for dismantling the advertising economy and replacing it with a transparent, user-controlled choice system.
# Choice-Driven Economy

## Overview
This repository contains a working blueprint for transitioning from an advertising-driven global economy to a truly choice-driven system, where people discover and select products, services, and media without manipulation.

## Goals
- Replace advertising funding models with sustainable, ethical alternatives.
- Build open discovery tools that put users in control.
- Design ethical "choice architecture" that supports informed decisions.
- Implement regulations to prevent regression into manipulative practices.
- Facilitate a cultural shift toward mindful consumption.

## Structure
1. **Funding Models** – Alternatives to ad revenue.
2. **Discovery Systems** – How people can find things without ads.
3. **Ethics Framework** – Principles and safeguards.
4. **Transition Plan** – Step-by-step migration from ads to choice.
5. **Culture Shift** – Education, prestige, and narrative changes.

## Why This Matters
Advertising today isn't neutral—it's engineered to manipulate behavior. By rethinking discovery, funding, and decision systems, we can create a marketplace that serves people, not just profit.
